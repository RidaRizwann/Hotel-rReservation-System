# Hotel-rReservation-System
This project is a console-based Hotel Reservation System developed in C. It automates hotel room bookings by allowing users to add, view, search, update, and delete reservation records. The system uses file handling, structures, loops, and conditional statements to efficiently manage customer data.
The Hotel Reservation System is a console-based application developed in C programming language. It automates hotel room booking operations by allowing users to add, view, search, update, and delete reservation records. The system uses file handling, structures, loops, and conditional statements to efficiently manage customer data and provide an organized alternative to manual record-keeping.
Features
Add Room Reservation: Record customer details such as name, address, room type, and stay duration.
View All Reservations: Display all stored bookings in an organized manner.
Search Reservation: Search by customer name or room number for quick retrieval.
Delete Reservation: Remove reservation records for cancellations or corrections.
Update Reservation (optional): Edit existing customer information without re-entering data.
Check Room Availability: View which rooms are booked or available.
User-Friendly Menu Interface: Simple, numbered, text-based navigation.
File-Based Storage: Permanent storage of records in text or binary files.
\Technologies Used
Programming Language: C
File Handling Functions: fopen(), fclose(), fwrite(), fread(), fprintf(), fscanf()
Data Structures: struct
Standard Libraries: <stdio.h>, <stdlib.h>, <string.h>, <time.h> (if required)

How to Run the Project
Install a C compiler (e.g., GCC, CodeBlocks, Dev-C++).
Open the main source file (e.g., hotel.c).
Compile the program.
Run the executable in the terminal/console.
Use the menu to add, view, search, update, or delete reservations. 
Project Objectives
Automate the hotel booking process.
Reduce manual errors in reservation records.
Provide accurate and efficient management of customer and room data.
Demonstrate application of C programming concepts like loops, conditions, functions, and file handling.
Offer a user-friendly interface suitable for small-scale hotels.
Background Problem
Small hotels often rely on handwritten registers, which can lead to:
Difficulty in tracking room availability.
Errors in customer and booking information.
Time-consuming searches for past records.
Inefficient management of reservations.
This system provides a digital solution that ensures data accuracy, quick access, and simplified booking operations.
